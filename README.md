# README

This is a project to make a rails project to mess around with my last.fm data. Currently, it's working with my scrobbles up through July 10, 2019 (3 PM UTC).
Eventually I'd like to pull from the last.fm API to update regularly. This is going to be experimenting with some cool ways to display the data.
